# 五彩灯泡 Mobile (Colorful Light Bulbs for iPhone)

A touch-optimized mobile version of the match-3 puzzle game featuring colorful light bulbs, specifically designed for iPhone devices.

## Project Overview

"五彩灯泡 Mobile" is the iPhone adaptation of the original web-based match-3 puzzle game. This version is optimized for touch interactions, mobile screen sizes, and iOS performance considerations.

### Key Features

- Responsive design optimized for various iPhone screen sizes
- Touch-based swipe interactions for intuitive gameplay
- Four distinct colors: Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green
- Haptic feedback for enhanced user experience
- Offline play capability
- Game progress saving
- iOS-specific optimizations

## Development Approach

This project follows the Prompt Driven Development (PDD) approach, where comprehensive documentation is created before any code is written. This ensures:

1. Clear vision and direction for the mobile adaptation
2. Well-defined scope and requirements specific to iPhone devices
3. Thoughtful architecture and design decisions for mobile optimization
4. Efficient implementation process with mobile-first considerations
